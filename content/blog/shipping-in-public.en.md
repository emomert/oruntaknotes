# Shipping in Public

I log everything in weekly slices so I can see scope creep early. Each slice is a markdown file with the same slug but different dates.

## Week 1 — Framing

- Define the *promise* in one line.
- Pick 3 metrics to watch.
- Draw a kanban sketch for the blog post itself.

## Week 2 — Experiments

```markdown
- A/B hero copy in Turkish vs English
- Swap CTA placement on mobile
- Record scroll-depth vs read-time
```

## Week 3 — Cleanup

1. Remove dead experiments.
2. Write the post changelog in plain language.
3. Push assets into `uploads/` and link them with wiki syntax.
