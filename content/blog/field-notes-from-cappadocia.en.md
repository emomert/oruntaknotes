# Field Notes from Cappadocia

A weekend of balloons, basalt, and coffee before sunrise. I kept everything in markdown so I could ship photos later without rewriting.

## Packing list

- Fujifilm X100V + 35mm adapter
- One ND filter (for the balloons)
- A single SD card and a tiny power bank

## Route

1. Sunrise launch site (05:20)
2. Love Valley footpath (07:00)
3. Çavuşin rock church (09:30)

## Shot plan

I planned the day as a mini board. Each bullet was a shot.

```markdown
- wide valley from the ridge at sunrise
- silhouettes of balloons with basalt columns
- detail of cave texture, f/2 close-up
```

## Favorite frame

And here is a compressed JPG pulled straight from `uploads/`:

## Export notes

- I keep RAW in a dated folder and downsize web copies into `uploads/`.
- Captions live directly in markdown so Turkish/English stay aligned.
- If a post needs the same visual twice, I mix wiki images and plain paths to show both.
