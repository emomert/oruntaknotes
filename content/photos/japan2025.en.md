![A Tower and Night in Osaka](/uploads/japan1.jpg)

A structure we stumbled upon in Osaka that I liked. Although Osaka was nice, honestly, there wasn't much there.

One of the places I visited in Kyoto and liked the most during my entire trip. If you are in Kyoto, definitely go to the Arashiyama side and walk the paths people don't take.

A shot from the guestbook at the subway station close to the building where we stayed in Osaka, which really had nothing but spiders.

Again Kyoto, a shot from Arashiyama, Daihikaku Senkō-ji Temple... One of the most incredible places I've visited in my life.

Both Chinese cigarettes and Japanese cigarettes... But especially the Chinese cigarettes were very good.

Another shot from the world's best temple. It was very enjoyable to stand in front of the fans inside.

One of the things I liked most in Japan. The fact that there is care in every single house and the buildings distinguish themselves from one another.

Yes, these people seemed to be working very hard too. Especially the 80-year-old people working in places that look like breakfast spots.
