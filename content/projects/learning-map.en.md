## What it is

Learning Map is a visual roadmap builder for deep study. Every milestone exports to markdown so I can paste it into a blog post or ship it as a README.

## Features

- Swimlane view for topics, questions, and projects
- One-click export to `*.md` with bilingual sections
- Progress snapshots that link back here via wiki links

## Why it pairs with this blog

When I share an update, I embed the exported markdown directly. The wiki links resolve to published posts (for example [[bilingual-markdown-workflow]]) and the visuals live in `uploads/`.
