## Overview
Chord Helper is a web app for exploring, building, and visualizing chord progressions with instant playback so ideas are heard the moment they’re created. It’s aimed at musicians, producers, and educators who need to sketch arrangements, teach harmony, or prototype quickly without friction.

## Features & Experience
Interactive chord palettes and a progression timeline let you drag, drop, duplicate, and swap chords fluidly. Real-time audio preview works per chord or across the whole progression, with tempo and key controls for quick transposition. The interface is responsive and accessibility-minded, with keyboard shortcuts on desktop and smooth transitions that keep focus on the music.

## Design & Stack
Built with your modern stack (swap in React/Vue/Svelte) and component-driven styling (Tailwind/Styled Components/CSS Modules), using a clear color system for readability. The layout is minimal and music-focused, with consistent spacing and typography for a sight-reading feel, and it’s tuned to stay performant on mobile as well as desktop.
