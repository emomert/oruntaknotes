## What it is

Studio Handoff is a lightweight design-to-dev pipeline. Designers drop specs into markdown, and the system bundles assets plus a build-ready README.

## Workflow

1. Paste Figma notes (they become markdown).
2. Attach exports into `uploads/`.
3. Publish a bilingual spec that engineers can read in this site.

## Why markdown

Markdown keeps specs diffable. I add callouts with wiki-links to related retrospectives like [[shipping-in-public]] so context is never lost.
