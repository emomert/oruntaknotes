## What it is

Atlas Notes is a bilingual notebook that mirrors every page in Turkish and English. It keeps the slug stable while exporting Obsidian-style wiki links so you can cross-link thoughts.

## Highlights

- Offline-first sync with periodic push
- Dual-language panes for quick cross-checks
- Wiki-link autocomplete compatible with this blog's renderer
- Asset dropzone that writes straight into `uploads/`

## Stack

- React + TypeScript
- SQLite for local cache, optional Postgres sync
- Tailwind for layout primitives
